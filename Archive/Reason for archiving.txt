The delopement summary note is sorted from oldest to newest

p7.1_3v3:		2018
	Design smaller than FeatherWing footprint, control EN pin on feather to shutdown 3V3 regulator
	Major issue:	Unable to wake the Feather back up
			Too small D-Flipflop footprint that does not suit for hand soldering

OpenS-Power-1.0.0:	2018
	Designed for OpenSampler, convert 12V to 5V
	Major issue: 	Randomly turn off during operation
			GPIO_READ (RTC_READ) does not work
			Require external RTC

OPEnS-RTC-1.2:		2019
	Designed for general purpose, run on Vbat, with RTC and SD card headers
	Major issue:	NOT gates draw too much power in sleep
			The footprint is too large, too many components
			Require external SD card

Baos_Board:		2019
	Named by James, original idea by Mitch designed for eDNA that runs on 12V battery
	Major issue:	Voltage is not correct to change state of the MOSFET
			Board does not function

Sitka_Board		2019
	Design to periodically turn on the power and turn of the power with just change in hardware, no change in code
	Major issue:	The design was not finished
