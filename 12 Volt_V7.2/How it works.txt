The flipflop IC is work based on raising, positive edge of the clock (posedge)
The input D is always pulled HIGH.
The CLK is normally pulled low until triggered by the Feather.

In the original sleep state, when the RTC fires the alarm, the CLEAR (reset) is pulled down to GND -> make the output (Q) LOW
		-> Turn on the power regulator. The state remain the same since there is no change in the clock
When Feather fired the shutdown signal, the CLK goes low->high which copy the input (D) to the output (Q). Since D is always high,
		the output will change to HIGH -> shutdown the voltage regulator

System stay as sleep until the RTC fires again -> reset the flipflop
